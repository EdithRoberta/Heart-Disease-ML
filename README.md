# Heart-Disease-ML

The project is a machine learning classification problem.

This notebook looks into develop a ML model that is able to predict wheather a patient has heart disease based on medical parameters. To build a model it will be used Python-based ML and Data Science libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

* **environment.yml** - has all the packages of the environment
* **heart-disease-classification.ipynb** - contains the steps for building, evaluating and improving the classification model
* **heart-disease.csv** - dataset

The environment is created and managed through Conda.  
Steps to activate the environment that has all the packages from **environment.yml**:
1. Open Anaconda Prompt
2. Create a new project directory
    * `mkdir <name_folder>`
4. Create the environment on the new project directory
    * `conda env create --prefix ./env -f ./environment.yml`
5. Activate the environment
    * `conda activate ./env`
6. Open Jupyter Notebook
    * `jupyter notebook`
