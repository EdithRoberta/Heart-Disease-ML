# Heart-Disease-ML

The project is a machine learning classification problem.
This notebook looks into develop a ML model that is able to predict wheather a patient has heart disease based on medical parameters. To build a model it will be used Python-based ML and Data Science libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

`environment.yml` file - has all the packages of the environment
`heart-disease-classification.ipynb` file - contains the steps for building, evaluating and improving the classification model
